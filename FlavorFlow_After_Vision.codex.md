## Reflexive Flavor Flow Dashboard — The Standard of Hookah+ Lounge Excellence

### North Star Intent

To anchor the "After" UI/UX as the **definitive operational benchmark** for Hookah+ Lounge Owners. This is no longer a preview — it's the **expected experience**. The **log**, **visual richness**, and **reflexive overlay feedback** drive clarity, action, and customer satisfaction. This *moodbook-infused layer* isn't just UI polish — it's **revenue-mapped precision**.

### Core Logic – Flavored Flow Dashboard (After Standard)

#### Dashboard View Includes:

* 🖼️ HookahPlus logo at top left (sticky on scroll)
* 🧑‍🍳 Toggle: `Staff | Manager | Owner` (reflexive privileges control UI scope)
* 📸 Lounge Layout Snapshot (visual preview from YAML + uploaded photo)
* 🍍 Active Tables Rendered in Cards:
  * **Table ID (e.g. A1)**
  * **Flavor Mix (emoji-enhanced)**
  * **Timer (live)**
  * **Status: Heat, Flavor, Session Mood**
  * **Customer Notes (hover reveals feedback via tooltip or expand modal)**
  * 🔄 Refill Button (color pulses if due)
  * 📝 Add Note (Reflex Whisper can auto-suggest input)

#### 🪞 Moodbook Logic Embedded:

* **Color Gradients** shift by session length & feedback signal.
* **Shadow Depth & Glow** increase with trust indicators (e.g., "Happy Repeat Customer")
* **Flame Pulse**: Visual marker that a session is about to expire or needs attention.

#### 🌀 Reflexive Loop Triggers:

* ⏱️ Timer-based prompts
* 📥 Whisper-suggested refills or mood shifts
* 📊 Agent-generated "Session Drift" alerts (e.g., Timer >45 mins with no refill)
* 💬 Patron Insight Count: Live count per table (3 minimum expected per session)

#### 📦 Reflex Log Snapshot:

```
🗓️ Session: 35:12 min (B2)
💬 Insight #1: “Coal started to fade at 30 mins”
💬 Insight #2: “Love the grape flavor, very smooth”
💬 Insight #3: “Staff checked in right on time”
🧠 Reflex Summary: Positive. Auto-logged to Loyalty Profile.
```

### Lounge Owner Onboarding Logic

#### One-Click Onboarding (via YAML + Image)

* 📁 Upload Lounge Image
* 📄 Upload/Drop YAML of Table Layout
* 🔁 Auto-map tables to visual layout (via Visual Grounder)
* ✅ Instant Preview for placement accuracy
* 🧠 Reflex Setup Initialized:
  * Layout + Table Memory
  * Default pricing rules
  * Staff/Manager roles seeded

---

### Why This is Hot

* Owners SEE their data and tables *come alive*
* Staff gets nudged BEFORE customers complain
* Customers feel *seen*, *heard*, and *understood*
* It feels like luxury. But it **saves time** and **makes money**
* This is **hospitality gamified with integrity**

### Codex Embed Instruction

> Mark this After State as the new **default and aspirational baseline** for all Lounge Dashboards.
> Reflex Agents must treat this layout as the **trust-aligned benchmark** for simulation, feedback loops, Whisper Journals, and future Reflex Tiers.
