# Font Loading Best Practices for CI/CD

This document outlines the font loading strategy implemented to prevent CI/CD pipeline failures.

## Problem

The build process was failing in CI environments due to network requests to Google Fonts timing out or failing. This caused the entire CI/CD pipeline to hang or fail, preventing deployments.

## Solution

We implemented a conditional font loading strategy that:

1. **Detects CI Environment**: Uses `process.env.CI` to detect CI environments
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Provides system font fallbacks when Google Fonts are unavailable
3. **Resilient Loading**: Wraps font imports in error handling

## Implementation

### Font Configuration (`lib/fonts.ts`)

```typescript
// Conditional font loading for CI/CD resilience
const isCI = process.env.CI === 'true' || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test';

// Fallback font classes for CI environments
const fallbackFonts = {
  inter: { className: 'font-sans' },
  unifraktur: { className: 'font-serif' }, 
  raleway: { className: 'font-sans' },
};

// Use system fonts in CI, Google Fonts in development/production
```

### Usage in Components

```typescript
import { inter, unifraktur, raleway } from '../lib/fonts';

// Use the fonts normally - they automatically fallback in CI
<div className={inter.className}>Content</div>
```

## Benefits

1. **CI/CD Reliability**: Builds never fail due to font loading issues
2. **Development Experience**: Full Google Fonts in development and production
3. **Performance**: System fonts load instantly in CI environments
4. **Maintainability**: Single configuration file for all fonts

## CI Environment Variables

All CI workflows should set `CI: true` in their environment:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CI: true
    steps:
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting

If builds still fail with font-related errors:

1. Verify `CI=true` is set in the environment
2. Check that `lib/fonts.ts` is properly imported
3. Ensure fallback font classes are available in Tailwind CSS
4. Review network connectivity in CI environment

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Preloaded Fonts**: Download and bundle fonts - increases bundle size
2. **CDN Fonts**: Use different CDN - still has network dependency
3. **Local Fonts**: Store fonts in repo - licensing and maintenance issues
4. **Font Display Swap**: Helps with FOUC but doesn't solve CI network issues

The conditional loading approach was chosen for its balance of reliability, performance, and maintainability.
