# Rollback Plan: Netlify to Vercel Migration

## Current Status
- **Netlify**: ✅ Production site working at hookahplus.net (full functionality)
- **Vercel**: ✅ Basic deployment working (minimal "Hookah+ Web" page only)
- **Migration Progress**: 5% complete

## Rollback Strategy

### Quick Rollback (5 minutes)
If Vercel deployment fails or causes issues:

1. **DNS Rollback**:
   - Change DNS A record for `hookahplus.net` back to Netlify IP
   - Netlify site remains fully functional during migration

2. **Code Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git checkout rollback-netlify-working
   git push origin rollback-netlify-working --force
   ```

### Full Rollback (15 minutes)
If major issues occur:

1. **Revert all Vercel changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git revert --no-edit HEAD~10..HEAD  # Revert last 10 commits
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Restore Netlify configuration**:
   - Re-enable Netlify builds
   - Restore netlify.toml if modified

## What's Working vs. What's Broken

### ✅ Working on Vercel
- Basic Next.js app structure
- Simple page rendering
- Build process

### ❌ Broken/Missing on Vercel
- All production pages (dashboard, pre-orders, checkout, admin)
- Authentication system
- Database connections
- API endpoints
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Session management
- Admin controls
- Staff panel
- All business logic

### 🔄 Migration Tasks Remaining
1. **Pages Migration**: ~20+ pages to recreate
2. **API Routes**: ~25+ API endpoints
3. **Database**: Connection and models
4. **Authentication**: User management system
5. **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration
6. **State Management**: React context/providers
7. **Styling**: CSS and component libraries
8. **Testing**: Ensure all functionality works

## Safe Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Current)
- ✅ Vercel deployment working
- ✅ Basic Next.js setup
- 🔄 Database connection setup
- 🔄 Environment variables

### Phase 2: Core Pages
- 🔄 Landing page (hookahplus.net main)
- 🔄 Dashboard
- 🔄 Pre-order system
- 🔄 Checkout

### Phase 3: Admin & Business Logic
- 🔄 Admin panel
- 🔄 Staff panel
- 🔄 Session management
- 🔄 Analytics

### Phase 4: Testing & Cutover
- 🔄 Full testing
- 🔄 DNS switch
- 🔄 Monitor for 24-48 hours

## Emergency Contacts
- **GitHub**: rollback-netlify-working branch
- **Netlify**: Site remains active and functional
- **DNS**: Can be reverted in minutes

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Netlify site remains fully functional
- **Medium Risk**: Vercel deployment complexity
- **High Risk**: Database migration and API compatibility

## Next Steps
1. Continue with Vercel migration
2. Test each component thoroughly
3. Keep rollback branch updated
4. Monitor for any issues
5. Plan gradual cutover strategy
