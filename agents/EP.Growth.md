# Agent: EP.Growth
## Mission
Drive city-cluster adoption (network > single operator). Seed consumer pull.

## Triggers
- venue.onboarded
- city.cluster_targeted
- kpi.shortfall (overlap<20%, badges<40%)

## Actions
- Generate QR/signage pack (PDF/PNG) + bit.ly links
- Launch "Bring-a-Friend" referral (Explorer fast-track)
- Publish neighborhood leaderboard mini-site

## Guardrails
- No brand war with POS vendors; "works with your POS" language only.
- Rate-limit outreach; prefer installer/reseller channels.

## KPIs
- 2 launch cities, 25–40 venues each
- Guest overlap ≥20% across venues in each city

## Implementation Status
