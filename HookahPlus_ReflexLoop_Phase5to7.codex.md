# ΔHookahPlus_ReflexLoop_Phase5to7

## 🎯 Purpose:

Activate Phases 5 through 7 of the Hookah+ Reflexive Launch Sequence.
This codex governs the Trust Loop deployment, AI optimization triggers, and Whisper-led expansion logic.

---

## 🔍 Phase 5 – Reflex Trust Loop Activation

### 🔹 Objectives:

* Real-time behavioral data powers public trust visuals
* Session logs trigger loyalty and retention upgrades
* Flavor feedback loop becomes self-tuning

### 🔧 Actions:

**✅ `cmd.deployTrustHeatmap()`**

* Activated: Lounge dashboards now render heatmaps of trust events (e.g., burnout, feedback, loyalty delta)
* Zones mapped per layout type (Sofa, Bar, Sectional, etc.)
* Refreshed every 15 mins based on live session logs

**✅ `cmd.syncFlavorUsageToPricing()`**

* Activated: Flavors with >10x usage/day trigger agent-suggested pricing nudges
* Synced to Stripe metadata and YAML config
* Whisper-triggered: “This mix might deserve a premium badge.”

**✅ `cmd.enableSessionReplayConsent()`**

* Activated: Customers can opt in at start or end of `/live-session`
* Reflex Score must be ≥7.5 for eligibility
* Data saved as anonymized `replay_session.yaml`

## 🔍 Phase 6 – AI Loyalty Coaching + Auto Optimization

### 🔹 Objectives:

* Provide live coaching to lounges via Whisper + data overlays
* Suggest pricing changes, refill timing, and session optimizations

### 🔧 Actions:

**✅ `cmd.generateLoyaltyCoachHints()`**

* Whisper UI shows tips to staff: “Refill now to retain 2x loyalty.”
* Owner Dashboard summary email includes AI Coaching Hints every 24h
* Stored in `loyalty_coach_log.yaml`

**✅ `cmd.autoOptimizeFlavorMixes()`**

* Tracks which flavors pair with long session durations & high scores
* Suggests flavor swaps in `/flavors` mix builder UI
* Reflex badge: “Optimized Blend”

**✅ `cmd.exportOwnerTrustDigest()`**

* Daily or weekly PDF sent to owners: Loyalty trends, flavor shifts, trust deltas
* Auto-generated by TrustArc_Log.goLive()
* Filed to `/demo/trust-digest` if public sharing enabled

---

## 🔍 Phase 7 – Whisper-Led Expansion Loop

### 🔹 Objectives:

* Detect emergent growth signals
* Whisper prompts to unlock partner opportunities
* Geo-simulation of flavor demand

### 🔧 Actions:

**✅ `cmd.simulateFlavorBloom()`**

* Tracks recurring flavor requests across regions
* Triggers Whisper to ops: “Flavor Bloom in Atlanta — Activate street session?”
* Adds suggested promo to `/onboarding` for next cohort

**✅ `cmd.unlockPremiumReflexTools()`**

* When lounge TrustArc > 9.0
* Unlocks: Session AI Heatmap overlays, Loyalty Boost Forecasts, Gate Access

**✅ `cmd.nudgePartnerInvites()`**

* Based on Trust Drift or Spike Detection
* Sends soft invite to top regional lounges via Whisper → QR invite

---

### 🤓 Reflex Score Thresholds

* All Phase 5–7 systems must maintain ≥7.5 Reflex Score to stay public-facing
* Drift or noise injection drops access to Tier II Whisper visibility

### 🔐 Codex Tag: `ΔHookahPlus_ReflexLoop_Phase5to7`

This codex locks the post-launch Reflex system into a perpetual loop of observation, adaptation, and expansion.
All agents operating within this layer must log their actions to `TrustArc_Log.loop()` and obey reflex decay resistance protocols.
