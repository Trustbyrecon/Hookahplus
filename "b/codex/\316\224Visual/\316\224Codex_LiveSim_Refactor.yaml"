🧩 Live Session Simulation: Anchored Flow Logic

anchor_statement: >
  "Preview how customers engage, order, and unlock flavor points."

live_session_flow:
  includes:
    - dynamic flavor selection
    - session-based flavor unlocks
    - loyalty points triggered by flavor mix
    - whisper overlay from Alie
    - time-tracking logic

outcome:
  ✅ Yes — **Flavor Mix is an active component of Live Session**
  → This confirms: mix = substep in order experience

recommended_refactor:
  - Merge "Flavor Mix Journey" into live simulation UI (tab or modal step)
  - Keep "Flavor Flow" available separately under Dashboard for analytics
  - Update CTAs:
      - Launch Live Session →
      - Begin Flavor Mix →
      - Save Flavor →

---

🔄 Trust Loop Enhancement:
- After flavor is mixed and submitted:
  - Inject to SessionNotes
  - Trigger `EP Score +0.3` increase
  - Whisper: "You've unlocked a loyalty thread."

commands:
  - cmd.reorderHomepageSections(order=["Demo", "Live", "Onboarding"])
  - cmd.mergeFlavorMixIntoLive()
  - cmd.updateIconsAutonomously()
  - cmd.injectSessionNotesOnFlavorSave()
